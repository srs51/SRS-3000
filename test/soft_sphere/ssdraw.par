#
# *The light source/camera positions and look at/view directions are either in
# absolute (if fixed option) or relative (if centre-of-mass/particle option)
# coordinates.  In the case of coordinates relative to particles, the unit is
# either the radius of the selected particle/aggregate, or the default length
# unit, depending on the value of "Scale length by radius?".
#
# View motion controls (not applicable to all viewing options)...
# (Some explanation: changes in light/camera/view position take place over a
# number of frames determined by "Inertial control": 0 means the change is
# instantaneous; 1 means it takes the entire movie; < 0 indicates the exact
# number of frames to use for the transition.  If "Start at COM?" is true, the
# initial viewpoint will be the center of mass (of the selected view color),
# regardless of the view option.  If the LRG targeting option is selected, the
# target must be "Min. target mass frac." times the largest mass in the final
# frame to be used, otherwise the center of mass will be used.)
#
Start at COM?		0	! 0=NO,1=YES (to transition light/camera/view)

Potential sample order	0	! 0=random,1=file order,2=largest to smallest
Tree opening angle	0.5	! In radians
#
# POV-Ray parameters...
# (NOTE: for POV-Ray, particles of color "Draw color first", if enabled,
# are given high transparency.)
#

Renormalize?		1		! Use float workaround (0=NO,1=YES)
Aspect ratio		"(16/9)"	! E.g. "(1/1)", "(4/3)", "(16/9)"

Wall time offset	0.0	! In pkd units (may be needed for moving walls)
#

# Units (for focus distance, view size, patch dimensions, & orb freq only)...
#
Length unit	1.49597892e11	! In metres (1 AU = 1.49597892e11 m)
Time unit	5.0226355648e6	! In seconds (1 yr/2 pi = 5.0226355648e6 s)
#
# NOTES...
#
# For POV-Ray users: because POV-Ray uses single precision, you must insure
# that all lengths are mutually reasonable (i.e. don't put a camera 10 AU
# away from a scene that only measures 1 km across).  Also, very small
# numbers may not work.  Use normalization to fix.
#
# Light source/camera/view options:
#    FIX = fixed space coordinates (absolute, not relative)
#    LRG = relative to largest (most massive) particle/aggregate
#    POT = relative to gravitational potential minimum of system
#    COL = relative to center of mass of particles of given color
#    PID = relative to particle of given particle ID
#    OID = relative to particle/aggregate of given original ID
#    CAM = relative to camera (light source only)
#    DIR = orient along a fixed direction (view only)
# (for COL,PID,OID, the given value is specified by corresponding light
# source/camera/view lock)
