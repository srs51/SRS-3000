Current best estimates for DEM parameters:

Kinetic dKn = 2.063289e+12 kg/s^2 = 2.616767e-05 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2 (recommended)
Static dKn  = 1.600865e+07 kg/s^2 = 2.030298e-10 M_Sun/(yr/2pi)^2
dDelta (for recommended dKn) = 9.436757e-03 s = 1.878896e-09 yr/2pi

NOTE: Typical overlap duration  = 0.283103 s
      Typical propagation speed = 900.316 m/s
      Particle dynamical time = 1969.2 s (number of timesteps = 208673)
      Bulk dynamical time = 2442.5 s (number of timesteps = 258828)
